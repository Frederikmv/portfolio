									<h3 class="major">Abstract</h3>
									<p>This bachelor thesis examines roles and shareability in terms of technology use in the household as well as how they affect artifact ecologies of family members. Studies regarding artifact ecology as of far have mostly focused on personal and private artifacts and how they affect the one individual, however, a limited amount of research have been focused on how artifacts can be intertwined between different individuals' ecologies within households. Furthermore, limited amount of research have been conducted with regard to roles and shareability in the home. A preliminary ethnographic study was conducted in four households with the aim of creating floor plans for better understanding the location and shareability of technologies. Furthermore, a follow-up study was conducted to confirm our floor plans as well as further questions. With the results from the studies six roles were suggested describing the responsibilities regarding technologies in the household. To better understand whether an artifact is personal or shared in the complex setting of a household and what roles different family members takes upon themselves, two models were developed based on the findings from the two user studies. This bachelor aims to aid designers and researchers alike better understand the complex setting of a household by contributing with the tools necessary to analyze roles and shareability.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Shareability of technologies</h3>
											<p>We introduced the model shown above to gain a broader view on the shareability states of anartifacts in the home. With this the aim was to create a tool for researchers to analyze whehter artifacts are personal or shared in the context of the home</p>

											<h3 class="major">Roles and dynamics in households</h3>
											<p>We identified six common roles defined by individuals technology capabilities  in the home as a result of our user studies. The roles are dynami which means
that a family member is not confined to one role but can have several roles
as well as temporarily step into other roles depending on the context</p>
