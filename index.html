										<p>Mobile technologies have become an important part of run training, however, existing technologies focus on performance metrics (e.g., distance and pace),
										which makes it difficult for runners to improve their running technique. In this paper, we present Strive, a wearable running technology that aims to assist
										runners in achieving rhythmic breathing; a running technique that potentially leads to improved results and lower injury risk. Strive continuously collects
										physiological data and uses haptic feedback to provide real-time assistance during runs. As communicating technique-related information in the dynamic and
										complex context of a run is challenging, we present two studies. The first study investigates how runners adapt to two different vibration patterns; and the
										second study explores the temporality of the assistance through three different approaches: Continuous, periodical, and self-serviced. Based on these studies,
										we discuss and provide insights on interacting with technologies during runs.</p>

										<p>This bachelor thesis examines roles and shareability in terms of technology use in the household as well as how they affect artifact ecologies of family members.
										Studies regarding artifact ecology as of far have mostly focused on personal and private artifacts and how they affect the one individual, however, a limited amount
										of research have been focused on how artifacts can be intertwined between different individuals' ecologies within households. Furthermore, limited amount of research
										have been conducted with regard to roles and shareability in the home. A preliminary ethnographic study was conducted in four households with the aim of creating floor
										plans for better understanding the location and shareability of technologies. Furthermore, a follow-up study was conducted to confirm our floor plans as well as further questions.
										With the results from the studies six roles were suggested describing the responsibilities regarding technologies in the household. To better understand whether an artifact is
										personal or shared in the complex setting of a household and what roles different family members takes upon themselves, two models were developed based on the findings from
										the two user studies. This bachelor aims to aid designers and researchers alike better understand the complex setting of a household by contributing with the tools necessary to
										analyze roles and shareability.</p>

									<p> GEO assistent guides the user to a specific location using vibra-tions.  When the user is moving in the wrong direction, thebelt produces vibrations in the either the left or the right sidedepending on which direction the user is going.
										Hence, ifthe correct direction is turning left and the user turns right,the device will produce vibrations in the left side of the belt.When the user is following the correct direction, the vibrationsare turned off.</p>

									<h2 class="major">PlantIO</h2>
									<p>In this report we present the development of PlantIO, a scalable, secure, autonomous and self-sustaining system that aims to create theoptimal environment for any given plant. PlantIO continuously col-lects environmental data inside a greenhouse and uses this to respec-tively change the humidity, soil moisture and temperature using dif-ferent actuators in real-time to create the optimal environment for aplant. The adjustment of the environment was adjusted using controltheory and different sensors to measure the environmental data. We conducted a series of studies to see whether the system was scalable, secure and autonomous.</p>
