									<h3 class="major">Abstract</h3>
									<p>This pictorial essay is a collection of images that picture
										the theme of Social Cooling and social rating systems.
										The intention is to make people aware of a probable
										future where choices could be made based on a rating
										generated by algorithms. Furthermore, the intention is
										to show that these ratings are based on people’s choices
										throughout life and that these choices cannot avoid being
										biased by the ones designing it. In this contribution, the
										collection of images plays the role of documentation of
										our process and photo-ethnographic research.</p>


									<p>The installation took place at Aarhus library where four people at a time could interact with the prototype. Together they had to make a decision based on a scenarion together and the choices were only made when everyone had agreed and opened the same door each.
									The scenarios consisted of daily situations which, due to the rating system, will be rated and could eventually have a consequence for you. In the end the participants will be given a score according to the choices made.<p>

											<h3 class="major">The doors</h3>
											<p>The participants could open one of the two doors which were attached with small door hinges and to register the doors a LDR (light dependent resistor) was placed beneath which easily detected the incoming light when the door was opened.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Scenario</h3>
											<p>This image shows how the scenarios was presented where there are two options. This scenario presents Kasper who is a father of a five year old and married to Katrine. Due to unknown events Kasper have had some rough years and as a result gained a problem with alcohol.
											The choice Kasper now faces is to whether go to a doctor and acknowledge his problem and get the correct help and medication or if he should resolve this problem with his wife. This scenario, as with the others as well, we aimed to create a question where it is
										somewhat easy to make a choice as one is more responsible than the other. Here, in our opinion, the most reasonable choice would be to see a doctor, this would though result in that the government now knows you have a problem due to the prescription medicine which
									negatively influences your score.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Life path</h3>
											<p>The choices chosen is portrayed in the tubes where door A lights up one path and B another. In the end you can see the specific choices you as a group have made and try to reflect on why the score you have received is what it is. </p>
